# Object Tracker API

Trivial CRUD service implementation ideally using SQLite attempting to replicate the same service done in C#

## Goals

Would like to fully replicate the behaviour of one database per *object* using individual SQLite databases 
created on demand and deleted (optional) when *object* is deleted.
